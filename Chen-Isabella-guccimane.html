His older half-brother Victor introduced Gucci to hip-hop for the first time when Gucci was only six years old by bringing Gucci to a Run DMC, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J concert. Gucci enjoyed writing poetry as a child, and began rapping at the age of 14. Following his first arrest, Gucci began to take music seriously and released La Flare on Str8 Drop Records. It was pressed onto about 1000 CDs and distributed throughout East Atlanta.
